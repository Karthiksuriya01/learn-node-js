#NPM (node package manager)
NPM is a collection of all the open-source JavaScript libraries available in this world. It is the worldâ€™s largest software registry maintained by the Node.js team. There are many packages available on NPM which can be used for application development.


Syntax: npm install <package_name>[@<version>]


#Global Installation
To globally install any package or tool add -g to the command. On installing any package globally, that package gets added to the PATH so that it can be run from any location on the computer.

Syntax: npm install -g <package_name>

#Local Installation:
If -g is not added to the command for installation then, the modules get installed locally, within a node_modules folder under the root directory. This is the default mode, as well.

Syntax : npm install express
